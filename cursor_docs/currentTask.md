   - Full CRUD operations with proper authorization and validation

2. **Purchase API** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - `POST /api/events/[id]/purchase` - Mock ticket purchasing endpoint
   - Validates ticket availability, sale dates, and quantity limits

   - Installed `@radix-ui/react-switch` dependency
   - Integrated with form components

### üöß Next Steps: UI Integration & Testing

#### ‚úÖ Recently Completed:

1. **Organizer Profile Integration** - Event pages now display actual organizer profile information instead of placeholder data
   - Updated all event APIs (public, private, owner) to include organizer profile data
   - Enhanced EventPageClient component to show organizer name, bio, contact info, and social links
   - Properly handles cases where organizer profile doesn't exist (falls back to defaults)

2. **Streamlined Event Details UI** - Improved event page layout for better user experience
   - Removed tabbed interface for About, Schedule, and Location sections
   - Created unified, scrollable layout showing all event information in logical order
   - Maintained Q&A as a separate section when available
   - Improved information hierarchy and readability

3. **Advanced Interactive Mapping Integration** - Integrated stunning Mapbox GL JS visualization for event locations
   - **Dynamic Map Styles**: Street, Satellite, and Dark themes with instant switching
   - **3D Visualization**: Toggle between 2D and 3D views with smooth animations and atmospheric effects
   - **Custom Event Markers**: Animated, gradient markers with pulsing effects and custom popups
   - **Interactive Features**: 
     - Real-time geocoding of event addresses
     - Integrated directions via Google Maps
     - Event sharing functionality
     - Custom popup with event details, organizer info, and action buttons
   - **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading, error handling, and graceful fallbacks
   - **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly controls and adaptive layouts

#### üîÑ Currently Working On:

1. **Event Form Updates** - Add ticket settings to event creation/editing
2. **Event Display Updates** - Show ticket information on event pages  
3. **Purchase Flow UI** - Create ticket selection and mock checkout interface
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Add ticket management to organizer dashboard

#### üìã Remaining Tasks:

1. **Event Form Enhancement**:
   - Add ticket settings section to event creation form
   - Toggle between free events and ticketed events
   - Basic ticket creation during event setup

2. **Event Page Updates**:
   - Display available tickets with pricing
   - Show ticket availability and sale status
   - Add "Buy Tickets" button for ticketed events

3. **Purchase Flow**:
   - Ticket selection interface
   - Mock payment form with credit card fields
   - Purchase confirmation page
   - Email confirmation (using existing email system)

4. **Dashboard Enhancements**:
   - Ticket management section for event organizers
   - Sales analytics and purchase tracking
   - Ability to add/edit/disable tickets after event creation

5. **Registration Integration**:
   - Link ticket purchases to event registrations
   - Update registration flow for ticketed events
   - Handle free vs paid ticket scenarios

### üèÜ Technical Achievements So Far:

- **Complete Database Schema**: All models and relationships defined
- **Type-Safe APIs**: Full validation and error handling
- **Flexible Ticket System**: Supports free and paid tickets, quantity limits, sale dates
- **Mock Payment Processing**: Ready for real payment integration later
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable forms and UI components

### üîß Key Implementation Details:

1. **Ticket Types**:
   ```typescript
   interface Ticket {
     name: string;           // e.g., "General Admission", "VIP"
     price: number;          // 0 for free tickets
     maxQuantity?: number;   // null = unlimited
     saleStartDate?: Date;   // null = immediate
     saleEndDate?: Date;     // null = until event
     isActive: boolean;      // can be purchased
   }
   ```

2. **Mock Payment Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // Creates realistic mock transaction data
   const mockPaymentData = {
     mockCardNumber: '**** **** **** 1234',
     mockTransactionId: 'mock_1234567890_abc123',
     status: 'mock_success'
   };
   ```

3. **Event Integration**:
   - Events can have multiple ticket types
   - `hasTickets: false` = completely free event
   - `hasTickets: true` = has at least one ticket type
   - `requiresTickets: true` = must purchase ticket to attend

## üöÄ Next Session Goals

1. **Complete Event Form Integration** - Add ticket settings to event creation
2. **Implement Event Page Ticket Display** - Show tickets and purchase options
3. **Create Purchase Flow UI** - Mock checkout process
4. **Test End-to-End Flow** - Create event ‚Üí add tickets ‚Üí purchase tickets
5. **Update Dashboard** - Add ticket management for organizers
