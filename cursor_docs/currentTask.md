# Current Task: Advanced Mapbox Integration with Event Mapping

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Successfully implemented advanced Mapbox mapping integration for event locations with interactive 3D visualization.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Advanced Mapbox Integration
- Implemented comprehensive `src/components/event-map.tsx` with interactive features
- 3D visualization toggle with smooth animations (pitch/bearing transitions)
- Dynamic map styles (Streets, Satellite, Dark mode)
- Custom animated event markers with pulsing effects and gradients
- Real-time geocoding of event addresses to coordinates
- Interactive popups with event details and action buttons
- Integration with Google Maps for directions
- Event sharing functionality with native Web Share API
- Loading states and comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Server-Side Rendering Fix
- Fixed critical mapbox-gl server-side rendering errors
- Implemented dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to ensure client-only rendering
- Added beautiful loading states while map components initialize
- Resolved Next.js build cache issues with vendor chunks

### ✅ Event Page Integration  
- Seamlessly integrated EventMap into existing event page layout
- Maintained existing event page structure and organizer profile integration
- Clean location section with interactive mapping capabilities
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- Updated `next.config.ts` to properly expose Mapbox tokens
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` environment variable documentation
- Ensured secure API key handling with client-side access

## Technical Implementation Details

### EventMap Component Features:
- **Interactive Controls**: Map style switching, 3D toggle, directions, sharing
- **Custom Markers**: Animated pins with event-specific styling and information
- **Geocoding**: Automatic address-to-coordinates conversion using Mapbox API
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations  
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper cleanup and memory management

### Fixed Issues:
- ❌ **Server-side rendering errors** - Fixed with dynamic imports
- ❌ **Vendor chunk missing files** - Resolved with cache clearing
- ❌ **Build compilation issues** - Proper client-side only execution

## Next Steps

- ✅ Event mapping is fully functional and integrated
- ✅ Ready for production use with interactive mapping capabilities
- ⭐ **Focus**: The mapping system provides excellent location visualization without additional complexity

## Notes

- Weather integration was removed per user preference to keep the system focused and streamlined
- Mapbox integration is robust and ready for scaling
- Event pages now have beautiful, interactive location visualization
- All server-side rendering issues have been resolved

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Weather Data Display:**
   - Current temperature and "feels like" temperature
   - Weather condition with appropriate icons
   - Humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility metrics
   - Dynamic background colors based on weather conditions

2. **Smart Recommendations:**
   - Context-aware suggestions (umbrella for rain, warm clothes for cold weather)
   - Temperature-based clothing advice
   - Humidity and visibility considerations

3. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Loading states with smooth animations
   - Error handling with helpful messages
   - Action buttons for directions and sharing
   - Direct Google Maps integration

4. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - API response caching
   - Efficient city name extraction from full addresses
   - Lazy loading of weather data

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend:** React component with TypeScript interfaces
- **Backend:** Next.js API route with proper error handling
- **External APIs:** OpenWeatherMap integration
- **UI/UX:** Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **Icons:** Lucide React for consistent iconography

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

The enhanced location card is now ready for production. Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Extended Forecast:** Add 5-day weather forecast display
2. **Weather Alerts:** Push notifications for severe weather conditions
3. **Clothing Suggestions:** More detailed outfit recommendations
4. **Air Quality:** Integrate air quality index data
5. **Historical Weather:** Show weather patterns for similar dates

## Environment Variables Required

To use the weather functionality, add these to your `.env` file:
```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
```

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `src/components/enhanced-location-card.tsx` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/app/api/weather/route.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/app/event/[id]/event-page-client.tsx` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `env.txt` (UPDATED)
- ✅ `cursor_docs/currentTask.md` (UPDATED)

The enhanced location card successfully combines location information with real-time weather data, creating a rich, informative experience for event attendees.
