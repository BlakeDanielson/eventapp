# Current Task: Ticketing System Implementation - IN PROGRESS 🎫

## 🎯 Current Status: Implementing Ticket Sales Functionality

### ✅ Completed: Database Schema & Types

**Priority**: High (Core feature for monetization)
**Focus**: Add ticket sales functionality to events with mock payment processing

#### ✅ Database Schema Updates:

1. **New Models Added** ✅ COMPLETED
   - `Ticket` model: Stores ticket types, pricing, and availability
   - `Purchase` model: Tracks ticket purchases with mock payment data
   - Updated `Event` model: Added `hasTickets` and `requiresTickets` fields
   - Updated `Registration` model: Added `purchaseId` for linking registrations to purchases

2. **Migration Applied** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Successfully created and applied migration `20250606062120_add_ticketing_system`
   - Database schema updated with all new fields and relationships
   - Prisma client regenerated with new models

3. **TypeScript Types** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added `Ticket`, `Purchase`, and `PurchaseStatus` types to `src/types/event.ts`
   - Updated existing event interfaces to include ticket data
   - Added comprehensive form schemas in `src/types/forms.ts`
   - Created `TicketFormData`, `PurchaseFormData` types with validation

#### ✅ API Endpoints Created:

1. **Ticket Management APIs** ✅ COMPLETED
   - `GET/POST /api/events/[id]/tickets` - List and create tickets for an event
   - `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/events/[id]/tickets/[ticketId]` - Individual ticket management
   - Full CRUD operations with proper authorization and validation

2. **Purchase API** ✅ COMPLETED
   - `POST /api/events/[id]/purchase` - Mock ticket purchasing endpoint
   - Validates ticket availability, sale dates, and quantity limits
   - Creates mock payment data and updates sold quantities
   - Returns purchase confirmation with transaction details

#### ✅ UI Components:

1. **TicketForm Component** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Comprehensive form for creating/editing tickets
   - Pricing, availability, and sale date configuration
   - Active/inactive toggle and multiple purchase settings
   - Visual feedback for free tickets and sold quantities

2. **Switch Component** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added missing Radix UI Switch component
   - Installed `@radix-ui/react-switch` dependency
   - Integrated with form components

### 🚧 Next Steps: UI Integration & Testing

#### 🔄 Currently Working On:

1. **Event Form Updates** - Add ticket settings to event creation/editing
2. **Event Display Updates** - Show ticket information on event pages
3. **Purchase Flow UI** - Create ticket selection and mock checkout interface
4. **Dashboard Integration** - Add ticket management to organizer dashboard

#### 📋 Remaining Tasks:

1. **Event Form Enhancement**:
   - Add ticket settings section to event creation form
   - Toggle between free events and ticketed events
   - Basic ticket creation during event setup

2. **Event Page Updates**:
   - Display available tickets with pricing
   - Show ticket availability and sale status
   - Add "Buy Tickets" button for ticketed events

3. **Purchase Flow**:
   - Ticket selection interface
   - Mock payment form with credit card fields
   - Purchase confirmation page
   - Email confirmation (using existing email system)

4. **Dashboard Enhancements**:
   - Ticket management section for event organizers
   - Sales analytics and purchase tracking
   - Ability to add/edit/disable tickets after event creation

5. **Registration Integration**:
   - Link ticket purchases to event registrations
   - Update registration flow for ticketed events
   - Handle free vs paid ticket scenarios

### 🏆 Technical Achievements So Far:

- **Complete Database Schema**: All models and relationships defined
- **Type-Safe APIs**: Full validation and error handling
- **Flexible Ticket System**: Supports free and paid tickets, quantity limits, sale dates
- **Mock Payment Processing**: Ready for real payment integration later
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable forms and UI components

### 🔧 Key Implementation Details:

1. **Ticket Types**:
   ```typescript
   interface Ticket {
     name: string;           // e.g., "General Admission", "VIP"
     price: number;          // 0 for free tickets
     maxQuantity?: number;   // null = unlimited
     saleStartDate?: Date;   // null = immediate
     saleEndDate?: Date;     // null = until event
     isActive: boolean;      // can be purchased
   }
   ```

2. **Mock Payment Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // Creates realistic mock transaction data
   const mockPaymentData = {
     mockCardNumber: '**** **** **** 1234',
     mockTransactionId: 'mock_1234567890_abc123',
     status: 'mock_success'
   };
   ```

3. **Event Integration**:
   - Events can have multiple ticket types
   - `hasTickets: false` = completely free event
   - `hasTickets: true` = has at least one ticket type
   - `requiresTickets: true` = must purchase ticket to attend

## 🚀 Next Session Goals

1. **Complete Event Form Integration** - Add ticket settings to event creation
2. **Implement Event Page Ticket Display** - Show tickets and purchase options
3. **Create Purchase Flow UI** - Mock checkout process
4. **Test End-to-End Flow** - Create event → add tickets → purchase tickets
5. **Update Dashboard** - Add ticket management for organizers
