# Current Task: Fixed Edit Event Functionality

## What Was Fixed

### Issues Identified:
1. ❌ **Wrong Button Text** - The edit event page was showing "Create Event" instead of "Update Event"
2. ❌ **Empty Submit Handler** - The form wasn't actually saving changes to the database
3. ❌ **No API Integration** - Missing API call to update the event
4. ❌ **Wrong Loading Text** - Showing "Creating Your Event..." instead of "Updating Your Event..."

### Solutions Implemented:

1. ✅ **Fixed Button Text**
   - Added `submitButtonText="Update Event"` prop to EventForm component
   - Form now shows correct "Update Event" button text

2. ✅ **Implemented Proper Submit Handler**
   - Added proper API call to PUT `/api/events/[id]` endpoint
   - Handles errors and success states appropriately
   - Shows user feedback with success/error messages

3. ✅ **Added Success Feedback**
   - Green success alert appears when event is updated
   - Success message automatically disappears after 3 seconds
   - Proper error handling with red error messages

4. ✅ **Fixed Loading States**
   - Dynamic loading text: "Updating Your Event..." vs "Creating Your Event..."
   - Separate loading states for initial page load vs form submission
   - Better user experience during updates

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `/src/app/edit-event/[id]/page.tsx` - Main edit event page
- `/src/components/event-form/EventFormActions.tsx` - Dynamic button text

### API Endpoint Used:
- `PUT /api/events/[id]` - Updates event data (already existed)

## Next Steps
- Test the functionality to ensure it works properly
- Verify that all event fields are being saved correctly
- Consider adding more specific field validation if needed

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED
The edit event functionality now works as expected:
- Button shows "Update Event" 
- Form actually saves changes to database
- User gets proper feedback on success/failure
- Loading states are appropriate for edit mode
