# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Access Control and Unique Event Links
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable private event pages accessible only via unique, shareable links.
# Details:
Generate unique event IDs and corresponding shareable URLs. Restrict access to event pages to only those with the correct link. Store event data in SQLite using Prisma.

# Test Strategy:
Test that only users with the correct link can access the event page. Verify unique link generation and persistence.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement unique event ID generation system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a mechanism to generate unique identifiers for each event that will be used in shareable URLs
### Details:
Develop a function that generates cryptographically secure random strings or UUIDs for each event. Ensure IDs are collision-resistant and follow best practices for URL-safe characters. Update the Prisma schema to include this unique identifier field for events.

## 2. Implement shareable URL generation and routing [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a system to generate shareable URLs based on event IDs and set up routing to handle these URLs
### Details:
Develop URL generation functions that incorporate the unique event IDs. Implement route handlers that can parse incoming URLs to extract event IDs. Configure the application router to direct users to the appropriate event page based on the URL.

## 3. Develop access control middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create middleware to verify access permissions before allowing users to view event pages
### Details:
Implement middleware that intercepts requests to event pages and validates the event ID from the URL. Design the validation logic to query the database and confirm the event exists. Handle unauthorized access attempts with appropriate error responses or redirects.

## 4. Update database schema and queries [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Modify the Prisma schema and database queries to support the access control system
### Details:
Update the Prisma schema to include fields for access control, such as visibility settings and the unique event ID. Create database queries to retrieve events by their unique IDs. Implement data validation to ensure all events have the required access control fields.

## 5. Create user interface for sharing event links [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.4
### Description: Develop UI components that allow event creators to view and share their unique event links
### Details:
Design and implement UI components that display the unique event link to event creators. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy sharing. Include visual indicators of the event's private status and access restrictions. Provide clear instructions to users about how the private links work.
