The user wants to update the subtask description for creating UI components that allow organizers to select predefined email templates and edit details like event name and date. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the current subtask details. The existing description mentions developing form components with rich text support, timing options, previews, saving drafts, and setting defaults. The user's request adds selecting from predefined templates and editing key details.\n\nThe search results mention UI elements like buttons, CTAs, and responsive design. Result [1] talks about making emails adaptable across devices, which might relate to the UI components needing responsiveness. Also, [5] discusses a dialog for picking email templates, which is directly relevant. The user wants organizers to select templates, so incorporating a template picker UI is essential. \n\nIn the ServiceNow community post [5], they created a dialog window for selecting templates, which could inspire the UI component here. The new description should include a template selection interface, maybe a modal or dropdown, allowing users to choose from existing templates. Then, after selection, they need to edit event-specific fields like name and date. \n\nThe current subtask already has rich text and preview features, so the update should integrate the new elements without duplicating existing info. Also, considering responsive design from [1], the UI should work well on different devices. \n\nI need to ensure the new text only includes the additions from the user's request. The existing details about rich text, timing options, etc., stay unless the user specifies changes. The focus is on adding template selection and editable fields. \n\nSo, the updated description should mention creating UI components for template selection (like a dialog or dropdown), editing event details, validation for required fields, and ensuring the UI is responsive. It should also allow saving as drafts and setting defaults, which are already in the current details but might need to be mentioned in context.\n</think>\n\nCreate UI components enabling organizers to browse and select from predefined email templates through a searchable grid or dropdown interface. Implement editable form fields for dynamically updating event-specific details (name, dates, locations) with real-time previews of merged content. Include validation rules for required fields and template compatibility checks. Design template selection workflow with a two-step modal interface: template category filtering followed by visual previews of layout options.\n</info added on 2025-06-06T01:10:53.964Z>",
