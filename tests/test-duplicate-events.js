console.log('üîç Duplicate Event Fix Verification');
console.log('=====================================\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Issues Fixed:');
console.log('1. Removed duplicate createEvent() call from EventForm component');
console.log('2. EventForm now only calls parent onSubmit() once');
console.log('3. No more double API calls to /api/events during creation\n');

console.log('üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix:');
console.log('- User fills out event creation form');
console.log('- User clicks "Create Event" button');
console.log('- Single API call made to POST /api/events');
console.log('- Single event created in database');
console.log('- User redirected to dashboard with success message');
console.log('- Dashboard shows exactly ONE event tile for the new event\n');

console.log('üß™ Manual Testing Steps:');
console.log('1. Visit http://localhost:3000 and sign in');
console.log('2. Click "Create Event" to go to /create-event');
console.log('3. Fill out event form with unique title (e.g., "Test Event [timestamp]")');
console.log('4. Set status to "Published"');
console.log('5. Click "Create Event" button');
console.log('6. Verify redirect to /dashboard');
console.log('7. Check that ONLY ONE event tile appears for your new event');
console.log('8. Visit Prisma Studio (http://localhost:5555) to verify only one database entry\n');

console.log('üîß Root Cause (Now Fixed):');
console.log('- EventForm.handleFormSubmit() was making TWO API calls:');
console.log('  1. createEvent(values) ‚Üí POST /api/events');
console.log('  2. onSubmit(values) ‚Üí POST /api/events (via parent component)');
console.log('- This resulted in identical events being created');
console.log('- Solution: Removed the redundant createEvent() call\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Fix Applied Successfully!');
console.log('The duplicate event creation issue should now be resolved.');
